This repository contains the assignment for the course of Databases. The purpose of it was to implement a SQL database in MySQL and familiarize with views and quarries.

The database was designed in the scenario of an application - a guide for organizing excursions in the natural landscapes of Greece.

EscursionDB stores information about mountains, rivers, lodgings, recreation areas, routes and through appropriate correlations, anyone interested can find out, for example, which mountain or river each route is associated with and what places and activities they may encounter.

Below are the entity diagram and the correlation diagram that reflect the base format:

Finaly, it is noted that the database depicted above is accompanied by views that can be seen when executing the **dbdump.sql** file. Some examples of data are in the csv files inside the **csvData** folder and some quaries are in the **Quarries**.
